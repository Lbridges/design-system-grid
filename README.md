## Purpose / Intended for
This repository reflects the work on one step in a process of web development.
The layouts constructed on this page can be copied to other front end development projects.
The next step for layouts copied from this structure is to be configured into a WordPress theme.

I have found it makes more sense to develop your layout and refine your styles with simple html/css
*before assembling a theme in WordPress. Page loads are much faster. 


The purpose of the grid is to break down layout patterns into a labeled guide.
The focus is small business promoting services of different types with different levels.

The key is to keep all content and styles general / boilerplate. Each button must have a purpose.
We are using the link structure and layout to guide our visitor where we want them to go.

## Contents / Dependencies
Repo Contains:
- A page named components for saving unused work, with hopes of future purpose
- Styles for component scraps are saved in a separate file, not compiled
- A single page of html with custom styles
- SCSS
- Bootstrap
